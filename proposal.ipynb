    "Byrnes (2005, p. 74) lists the following three main observations concerning the performance gap in mathematics:\n",
    "- Male students perform much better than female students on the SAT math test.\n",
    "- There is no convincing evidence for such gender differences prior to high school.\n",
    "- The subjective assessment of their own competence is higher in case of male students in both elementary and high school - independent of actual abilities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Nutall et. al. (2005) highlight that this male superiority in mathematical skills is only prominent among high-ability students in middle or higher schools, and is mainly reflected in the results of achievement tests (such as the SATs), while female students in general get better grades, even in mathematical subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A US-wide study including the performance of students from grade 2 to 11 by Hide et. al. (2008) argues that these differences in performance have completely disappeared by now. However, the authors note that standard tests lack more advanced tasks that could provide an in-depth assessment of mathematical abilities. Also, they found a greater variance in male students' performance, which might still explain the predominance of males in professions requiring highly advanced mathematical skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brunner et. al. (2008) analysed the performance of german high-school students on several tests of cognitive abilities. They have found that the small observed difference in math-related tasks in favor of males becomes greater, if general cognitive abilities that facilitate task interpretation are controlled for. Thus, in order to measure pure differences in mathematical skills we have to take into account the compensatory role of female students' verbal advantage."

    "In this study I address the following question: ***How does early gender-specific stimulation affect the development of advanced mathematical skills, through its influence on early cognitive abilities?***\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below provides an overview of all the potential causal pathways between gender (in the social sense of the term) and advanced math skills. The path of interest is the one marked with yellow, which connects gender with advanced skills through an early cultural influence on the development of cognitive abilities that in turn partially determine later motivations and the exposure to advanced learning opportunities. All these factors contribute to the development of high-school level math skills in an interrelated manner.\n",

    "### 2.1 Spatial reasoning ability as a mediator <a id=\"2.1\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Mental rotation - the ability to rotate objects using one's visual imagination - shows a substantial gender difference. It is traditionally measured with the water levels test (WLT), in which subjects have to draw the surfice of water inside complex geometrical objects after an imaginary rotation. Nutall et. al. (2005) found a correlation between female students' mental rotation skills and their SAT math scores independent of their verbal abilities. Furthermore, previously significant gender differences completely disappeared after controlling for the ability to mentally rotate images. The authors also observed that when building with blocks, male high school students focus more on structural properties and are capable of building more stable constructions than female students. In light of these finding, I am going to use mental rotation ability as a proxy for early skills that are relevant to my query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nutall et. al. remark that there's huge gender difference in the amount of interest and time spent building with blocks in childhood, which may strongly affect the development of spatial reasoning skills. Boys are willing to fight to have the blocks for themselves, while girls are rarely interested in these toys. Thus, a preference for building block-type activities in childhood may be a good measure of early skill-enhancing  stimulation. In order to answer my query, I have to isolate the effect of cultural factors on these preferences from inborn traits that may also influence early skills directly and indirectly, though biologically determined interests."

    "\n",
    "Differences in mental rotation ability are already detectable in 3- to 5-month-old infants, which suggests an inborn advantage of males that preceeds cultural influences. Furthermore, boys shortly after birth show stronger visual preferences for mechanical toys such as mobiles, balls and vehicles, while girls prefer toys with human attributes (e.g. dolls). (Alexander & Wilcox, 2012)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nutall et. al. (2005) used handedness as a proxy for contralateral hemisphere dominance, and identified three types:\n",
    "- Left-handers have poorer verbal and varied spatial abilities.\n",
    "- Homozygotic right-handers (with right-handed relatives) have stronger verbal and poorer spatial abilities.\n",
    "- Heterozygotic right-handers (who have left-handed relatives as well) may have an advantage compared to homozygotics, as they carry both alleles and thus they are not as strongly left-hemisphere dominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors found that, within the math/science majors, heterozygotic right-handed women outperformed their homozygotic peers and achieved similarly to men in mental rotation tasks, even if controlled for parents’ educational level and math and verbal aptitude scores. In another study, for both boys and girls reporting extensive spatial experiences with their brothers in their childhood, heterozygotic right-handers performed significantly higher on the mental rotation test than their heterozygotic peers. These results indicate that handedness is a good proxy for the genetic component of differences in spatial and consequently mathematical abilities. However, Byrnes (2005) warns that such hemispheric assymmetries may not only be of genetic or hormonal origin, but also dependent on experience: those, who engage their right hemisphere more often may consequently undergo additional brain development."

By assuming that the only mediator of this effect is early stimulation ($\\large S$), I could use Pearl & Mackenzie's (2018, p. 209) formula to eliminate the $\\large do$ operator. The problem is however that the confounder *genetics* may have a direct effect not only on the outcome, but also on the mediator, rendering frontdoor adjustment unfeasible.

I chose an RCT to eliminate the most problematic backdoor path: the hardly measurable direct effect of genetics on early preferences. I assume that gender affects early stimulation mainly through children's tendency to follow the typical behavioral patterns of their peers. The experiment involves infants in the early phase of development, before nursery school that can be regarded as the first exposure to social norms. Before the treatment, participants are presented a forced-choice test between two types of toys: building blocks and a doll, which are meant to represent traditionally masculine mechanical-geometric and traditionally feminine verbal-social types of stimuli, respectively. The difference in the ratios of boys and girls choosing the building blocks is measured and is denoted by $\\large D$.\n",

    "- In treatment group 1, subjects are repeatedly shown advertisement-like videos of boys playing with building blocks and girls playing with dolls, over the course of several weeks.\n",
    "- In treatment group 2, the toy-gender pairings are reversed in the advertisements.\n",
    "- In the control group, no videos are shown.\n",

As any backdoor path between these two variables has to lead through inborn skills, which can be controlled for through handedness, I rely on observational data to estimate this effect.

    "- $\\large M$: performance on the mental rotation (WLT) task,\n",
    "- $\\large S$: standardized reports on the frequency of activities throughout nursery school that require geometrical thinking and mechanical skills (this is a composite index contructed of a few representative items, such as building blocks, vehicles, strategic computer games etc.),\n",

    "\n",
    "Early skills affect later motivations and the exposure to tasks that further enhance abilities. More motivated and skillful students are more likely to get higher quality education and improve faster. Such differences snowball over time, leading to ever larger gaps in performance. Apart from early skills, additional cultural factors may also contribute to this phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stereotypes about typically masculine and typically feminine abilities may discourage girls and consequently, they might invest less in their mathematics studies from early on, be less likely to participate advanced math programmes, and perform worse due to the lack of confidence. However, there are some observations that are inconsistent with the discouragement argument. Amoung high-ability students, males and females only differ in terms of mathematics skills, but not in their expectations about their own performance. Also, female students in general get better grades than male students, and only perform worse in SAT-like tests. An additional effect of stereotypes may be that female students receive less attention from implicitly gender-biased teachers and even parents, who expect better performance from male students and therefore give them preferential treatment. This claim is supported by the observation that the severity of gender-related stereotypes and the difference in mathematical abilities are correlated across countries. (Byrnes, 2005)"
